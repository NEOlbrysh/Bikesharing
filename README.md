An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau

## Overview

The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:
- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How much are the bikes used and by whom?
## Results

While the demographics of Des Moines may be different from the makeup of the citizenry of NYC, a cursory look at the makeup of CitiBike riders may shine light on who bikeshare might appeal to, regardless of locale.
